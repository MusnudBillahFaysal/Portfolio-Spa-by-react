## Introduction

The Krinky project is a React-based portfolio website showcasing design and development services. It includes sections for Home, Services, Skills, Portfolio, and Contact. The website is designed to provide an interactive and visually appealing user experience.

## Code Structure

The project code is structured as follows:

- `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
- `App.js`: The main application component.
- `components/`: Directory containing various sections of the website.
  - `Home.js`: Home section with dynamic word animation.
  - `Services.js`: Services section with descriptions.
  - `Skills.js`: Skills section displaying different skills.
  - `Portfolio.js`: Portfolio section showcasing projects.
  - `Contact.js`: Contact section with a form to send emails.
- `index.css`: Main CSS file for styling the components.

## Home Component

The Home component (`Home.js`) displays the introductory section of the website. It includes a dynamic word animation and a "Contact Now" button. The content is responsive and styled using CSS.
